## 🔥 News
- **Dec 30, 2025**: 🤗 We released the inference code and pretrained models of [HY-Motion 1.0](https://huggingface.co/tencent/HY-Motion-1.0). Please give it a try via our [HuggingFace Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/tencent/HY-Motion-1.0) and our [Official Site](https://hunyuan.tencent.com/motion)!


## **Introduction**

**HY-Motion 1.0** is a series of text-to-3D human motion generation models based on Diffusion Transformer (DiT) and Flow Matching. It allows developers to generate skeleton-based 3D character animations from simple text prompts, which can be directly integrated into various 3D animation pipelines. This model series is the first to scale DiT-based text-to-motion models to the billion-parameter level, achieving significant improvements in instruction-following capabilities and motion quality over existing open-source models.

### Key Features
- **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in both instruction-following capability and generated motion quality.

- **Billion-Scale Models**: We are the first to successfully scale DiT-based models to the billion-parameter level for text-to-motion generation. This results in superior instruction understanding and following capabilities, outperforming comparable open-source models.

- **Advanced Three-Stage Training**: Our models are trained using a comprehensive three-stage process:

    - *Large-Scale Pre-training*: Trained on over 3,000 hours of diverse motion data to learn a broad motion prior.

    - *High-Quality Fine-tuning*: Fine-tuned on 400 hours of curated, high-quality 3D motion data to enhance motion detail and smoothness.

    - *Reinforcement Learning*: Utilizes Reinforcement Learning from human feedback and reward models to further refine instruction-following and motion naturalness.

*Note*: To reduce GPU VRAM requirements, please use the following settings: `--num_seeds=1`, text prompt with less than 30 words, and motion length less than 5 seconds.  

## 🤗 Get Started with HY-Motion 1.0

HY-Motion 1.0 supports macOS, Windows, and Linux.


- [Code Usage (CLI)](#code-usage-cli)
- [Gradio App](#gradio-app)


#### 1. Installation

First, install PyTorch via the [official site](https://pytorch.org/). Then install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/HY-Motion-1.0.git
cd HY-Motion-1.0/
# Make sure git-lfs is installed
git lfs pull
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 2. Download Model Weights
Please follow the instructions in [ckpts/README.md](ckpts/README.md) to download the necessary model weights.

### Code Usage (CLI)

We provide a script for local batch inference, suitable for processing large amounts of prompts.

```bash
# HY-Motion-1.0
python3 local_infer.py --model_path ckpts/tencent/HY-Motion-1.0

# HY-Motion-1.0-Lite
python3 local_infer.py --model_path ckpts/tencent/HY-Motion-1.0-Lite
```

**Common Parameters:**
- `--input_text_dir`: Directory containing `.txt` or `.json` prompt files.
- `--output_dir`: Directory to save results (default: `output/local_infer`).
- `--disable_duration_est`: Disable LLM-based duration estimation.
- `--disable_rewrite`: Disable LLM-based prompt rewriting.
- `--prompt_engineering_host` / `--prompt_engineering_model_path`: (Optional) Host address / local checkpoint for the Duration Prediction & Prompt Rewrite Module.
    - **Download**: You can download the Duration Prediction & Prompt Rewrite Module from [Here](https://huggingface.co/Text2MotionPrompter/Text2MotionPrompter).
    - **Note**: If you **do not** set these  parameter, you must also set `--disable_duration_est` and `--disable_rewrite`. Otherwise, the script will raise an error due to host unavailable.


### Gradio App

You can host a [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) web interface on your local machine for interactive visualization:

```bash
python3 gradio_app.py
```
After running the command, open your browser and visit `http://localhost:7860`


## Prompting Guide & Best Practices

1. Language & Length: Please use English. For optimal results, keep your prompt under 60 words. For other languages, please use the Text2MotionPrompter to rewrite the prompt. 

2. Content Focus: Focus on action descriptions or detailed movements of the limbs and torso.

3. Current Limitations (**NOT** Supported):

 - ❌ Non-humanoid Characters: Animations for animals or non-human creatures. 
 - ❌ Subjective/Visual Attributes: Descriptions of complex emotions, clothing, or physical appearance. 
 - ❌ Environment & Camera: Descriptions of objects, scenes, or camera angles. 
 - ❌ Multi-person Interactions: Motions involving two or more people. 
 - ❌ Special Modes: Seamless loop or in-place animations. 

4. Example Prompts:
 - A person performs a squat, then pushes a barbell overhead using the power from standing up.
 - A person climbs upward, moving up the slope.
 - A person stands up from the chair, then stretches their arms.
 - A person walks unsteadily, then slowly sits down.
